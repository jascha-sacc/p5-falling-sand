# p5-falling-sand
originally created by Dengel29

A falling sand implementation with p5. Uses the pixelArray to draw falling sand and sort according to simple falling sand logic. Inspired by Noita and ![Orb Farm](https://orb.farm/).

Extended by SpiralProgrammer to add color selection as well as brush size.
